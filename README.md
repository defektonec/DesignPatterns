# Design Patterns Repository
This repository is part of my preparation for upcoming exams. I am using it to practice writing and implementing various design patterns in C#. It serves as a personal learning tool to deepen my understanding of these essential programming concepts.
While this repository is primarily for my own use, it is not restricted to personal study alone. Others are welcome to explore it for educational purposes, whether you're learning design patterns yourself or looking for examples to help with your studies.
Feel free to clone, fork, or reference this repository. Happy learning!

## Existing Design Patterns
Here is a list of design patterns implemented in this repository, along with their brief descriptions:

1. Singleton
   Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
   
3. Builder
   Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
